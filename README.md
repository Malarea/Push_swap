# Push_swap

### Description
**Push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project written in C, where the goal is to sort a stack of integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. The challenge lies in sorting the numbers with the fewest moves possible, optimizing the algorithm for efficiency.

### Features
- Sorting algorithms: optimized for minimal operations
- Uses two stacks (A and B) and a set of predefined commands
- Handles small to large sets of integers

### Installation
Clone the repository and compile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```

### Usage
Run the program with a list of integers:

```bash
./push_swap 5 3 8 2 4
```
